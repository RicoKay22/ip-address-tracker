Frontend Mentor – IP Address Tracker Solution

This is a solution to the IP Address Tracker challenge from Frontend Mentor, completed as part of Web3BridgeAfrica Frontend Advanced (Cohort XIV).
The project allows users to view their IP address location on a map and search for other IP addresses using real geolocation data.


🧩 Overview
The challenge

Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size

See their own IP address and location on initial page load

Search for any IP address and view its geolocation details

See the location displayed dynamically on an interactive map

⚙️ My process
Built with

Semantic HTML5

CSS (Mobile-first workflow)

CSS Grid & Flexbox

Vanilla JavaScript

LeafletJS
 for interactive maps

IP Geolocation API by IPify

What I learned

This project helped me understand how to:

Work with third-party APIs in JavaScript

Integrate LeafletJS maps into a real project

Debug real-world issues like map rendering and tile loading

Handle asynchronous API requests and update the UI dynamically

Structure a frontend project properly for deployment

I also learned that IP geolocation data can vary depending on ISP routing and network conditions.

Continued development

In future versions, I would like to:

Add IP and domain validation before API requests

Improve error handling and loading states

Secure API requests using a backend or serverless function

Improve UI accessibility and color contrast

Useful resources

LeafletJS Documentation
 – Essential for understanding map rendering

IPify Geolocation API Docs
 – Helped with API requests and responses
