# **Frontend Mentor – IP Address Tracker Solution**

This is my solution to the **IP Address Tracker** challenge from **Frontend Mentor**, completed as part of **Web3BridgeAfrica Frontend Advanced (Cohort XIV)**.  
The project allows users to view their IP address location on a map and search for other IP addresses using real geolocation data.

---

## 🧩 Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size
- See their own IP address and location on initial page load
- Search for any IP address and view its geolocation details
- See the location displayed dynamically on an interactive map

## ⚙️ My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS** (Mobile-first workflow)
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **LeafletJS** for interactive maps
- **IP Geolocation API** by IPify

---

### What I Learned

This project helped me understand how to:

- Work with third-party APIs in JavaScript
- Integrate LeafletJS maps into a real project
- Debug real-world issues like map rendering and tile loading
- Handle asynchronous API requests and update the UI dynamically
- Structure a frontend project properly for deployment

> Note: IP geolocation data can vary depending on ISP routing and network conditions.

---

### Continued Development

In future versions, I would like to:

- Add IP and domain validation before API requests
- Improve error handling and loading states
- Secure API requests using a backend or serverless function
- Improve UI accessibility and color contrast

### Useful Resources

- [LeafletJS Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/) – Essential for understanding map rendering  
- [IPify Geolocation API Docs](https://www.ipify.org/) – Helped with API requests and responses  
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) – Helpful discussions and feedback
